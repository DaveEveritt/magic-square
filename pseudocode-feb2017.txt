# Given space-separated numbers of any length

## Is it the right number of integers for an n x n matrix?

- split into an array
- remove duplicates
- check that mod sqrt length == 0
- return sqrt length for the order (n)

## Are all numbers present from 1..n^2 (or 0..(n^2)-1)

- check that the lowest number is 0 or 1
- map the array to a new sorted array
- loop through, checking if each number is -1 of the next

=== TEST THIS FAR ===

## split the array into n-length sub-arrays
