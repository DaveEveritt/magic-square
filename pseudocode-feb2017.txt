# Magic Square checker in JavaScript

Given space-separated numbers of any length

## 1. Is it the right number of integers for an n x n matrix?

### DONE:
- split into an array
- remove duplicates
- check that mod sqrt length == 0
- return sqrt length for the order (n)

### TODO:
- check all array elements are integers
- OR
- force array elements to integers with div


## 2. Are all numbers present from 1..n^2 (or 0..(n^2)-1)

- check that the lowest number is 0 or 1
- map the array to a new sorted array
- loop through, checking if each number is -1 of the next

=== TEST THIS FAR ===


## 3. Prepare to check the magic properties

- Split the array into n-length sub-arrays?
- OR
- Parse through as a 1-dimensional array


## 4. Check the magic properties

- is semimagic?
- is magic?
- is most-perfect?
